```java

Manual Configuration
Manual configuration involves editing your own WSGI configuration file in /var/www/. Usually this imports a WSGI-compatible application which you've stored elsewhere

When you click "Next", we will create a WSGI file for you, including a simple "Hello World" app which you can use to get started, as well as some comments on how to use other frameworks.

You will also be able to specify a virtualenv to use for your app.
